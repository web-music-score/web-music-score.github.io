Hello!

This is another important update!

I am also personally learning so much to work more professinally!

## Library Changes
- Added Common time signature `"C"`.
- Added controls button layout `singlePlay` and new button setup functions for `score.WmsControls`.
- Made fermata part of articulation which is subtype of annotation. Fixed fermata layout issue.
- Gave default player for each document, but can also create and play player instances independently.

## Website Changes
- Improved website documents section a lot, also internal improvements.
- Removed AI generated stuff and wrote things myself.
