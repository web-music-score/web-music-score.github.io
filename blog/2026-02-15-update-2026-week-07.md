Hello!

I have published patch version 6.3.8 and pre-release version 6.4.0-pre.7.

My updates have been quite irregular. I am thinking of going into weekly updates.

The design hasn’t been very clear from the start. Since I’m not a professional
musician, many questions are still open. My focus has shifted from trying to
build a large, ambitious product to creating a simple, solid piece of music
software instead. For now, the priority is to refine what already works and
keep the scope small and manageable.
