# Info

## Author

I am Stefan, the author of **Web Music Score**, and I am about {new Date().getFullYear()-1980} years old.

I am hobbyist in both guitar and programming, but I am quite passionate and dedicated with this project.

I have learned some music theory independently, and more recently with the help of AI. As a result, there
may be musical errors, but I fix them on the go.

This project has been evolving for many years, starting with very simple app to play guitar notes on a staff.

There have been many changes, both internally and in the public interface. I do my best to avoid breaking
anything and continue supporting deprecated features until the next major version.
